            <h3>Gaussian splatting is a volume rendering technique that deals with the direct rendering of
                volume data without converting the data into surface or line primitives. The technique was
                originally introduced as splatting by Lee Westover in the early 1990s. With advancements in
                computer graphics, newer methods such as 3D Gaussian splatting and 3D Temporal Gaussian
                splatting have been developed to offer real-time radiance field rendering and dynamic scene
                rendering respectively. The technique was originally introduced as splatting by Lee Westover
